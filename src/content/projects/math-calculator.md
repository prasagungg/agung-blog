## Overview

This project is a specialized mathematical tool developed to assist high school students (specifically 10th grade) in understanding and solving Probability and Statistics problems. Unlike a standard calculator, this engine is programmed to handle specific formulas like Permutations, Combinations, and Factorials.

## Key Focus: Fundamentals & Algorithms

This project was built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**, without the aid of any frontend frameworks. The goal was to sharpen my understanding of the core language and DOM manipulation.

### 1. Mathematical Algorithm Implementation

The main challenge was translating abstract mathematical formulas into executable code.

- **Logic translation:** I had to write custom functions to handle calculations such as **Factorials (!)**, **Permutations (nPr)**, and **Combinations (nCr)**.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The logic had to be robust enough to handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers in factorials) and prevent infinite loops, ensuring the application remains stable.

### 2. DOM Manipulation (The "Hard" Way)

By avoiding frameworks like Vue or React, I manually handled the state and the UI updates.

- Understanding how to select elements, listen for events, and inject results back into the HTML gave me a deep appreciation for what frameworks do under the hood.

## Tech Stack

- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Used for all the logic, event handling, and state management.
- **Native CSS:** Custom styling to create a clean, academic, and user-friendly interface.

## Conclusion

This project serves as proof of my **Foundational Knowledge**. It demonstrates that I can write complex logic and build interactive applications using nothing but the core technologies of the web, proving that my skills go deeper than just knowing how to use a library.
