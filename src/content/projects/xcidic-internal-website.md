## Overview

A centralized web platform for Xcidic that serves two main purposes: a public-facing Company Profile and an internal Content Management System (CMS). The system allows administrators to manage website content dynamically and review incoming job applications in real-time.

## The Story: Crossing the Stack

This project holds a special place in my development journey as it marks my transition into **Full Stack Development**.

Initially, I was assigned strictly as a **Backend Developer**. My primary responsibility was to build a robust architecture using **NestJS** and design the database schema in **PostgreSQL**. However, after completing the backend logic and CMS API ahead of schedule, I saw an opportunity to assist the team further.

This became the **first time I fully dived into Frontend implementation**, moving beyond API responses to building actual User Interfaces.

## Key Challenge: The Logic vs. The Visuals

Transitioning from backend logic to frontend interactivity presented a unique set of challenges. The most significant hurdle was **implementing animations**.

As a developer used to structured data and procedural logic, dealing with the fluid nature of UI animations was a new frontier. A company profile needs to feel "alive," not just static. I had to learn how to:

- Bridge the gap between data logic and visual transitions.
- Implement smooth entry animations that enhance the user experience without causing layout shifts.
- Translate static designs into interactive components using Material UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (for SEO and SSR), Material UI.
- **Backend:** NestJS (for a structured, scalable API).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.

## Conclusion

This project proved that the boundary between Backend and Frontend is just a matter of perspective. Stepping out of my comfort zone to tackle the UI and animations not only helped the team meet the deadline but also expanded my technical capabilities significantly.
