## Overview

This project is a dedicated marketing platform for **Rumah Citra Garden Bintaro**, a premium real estate development. The website serves as a digital brochure to showcase property units, facilities, and master plans. The primary business goal was to capture leads by ensuring high visibility on search engines and providing an instant loading experience for potential buyers.

## Key Focus: The Balance of Speed and Visuals

Real estate websites face a common dilemma: they require high-resolution imagery to sell the lifestyle, but heavy images usually destroy website performance.

### 1. Achieving "Green" Core Web Vitals

My main challenge was to deliver rich media content without sacrificing speed.

- **Optimization Strategy:** I implemented aggressive image compression algorithms (WebP conversion) and lazy-loading techniques. This ensures that the high-quality hero images load instantly, while off-screen content is only fetched when needed.
- **Result:** The website achieves high scores on Google PageSpeed Insights, ensuring a smooth user experience even on mobile data networks.

### 2. Technical SEO Architecture

Speed alone isn't enough; the site needed to be found.

- **Semantic Structure:** I utilized Elementor efficiently to generate clean, semantic HTML structure that Google bots can crawl easily.
- **Keyword Optimization:** The site structure was designed to target specific property keywords, ensuring the landing pages rank competitively in search results.

## Tech Stack

- **WordPress:** The CMS of choice for its robust SEO plugins and content management flexibility.
- **Elementor Pro:** Used for custom layout design, but optimized to strip away unused CSS/JS to keep the code lightweight.

## Conclusion

This project proves that **WordPress sites don't have to be slow**. By applying strict performance optimization techniques, I delivered a site that is visually stunning, technically fast, and commercially effective.
