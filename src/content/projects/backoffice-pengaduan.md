## Overview

This application serves as the operational backbone for **PLN Mobile's Customer Support**. While millions of users report issues via the mobile app, this Backoffice Web Application is where the actual work happens. It allows the support team to receive, track, verify, and resolve customer complaints efficiently in real-time.

## Key Focus: Operational Efficiency

When dealing with a national-scale utility app, the volume of incoming tickets is massive. The UI/UX had to be designed not for "beauty," but for **Speed and Functionality**.

### 1. High-Volume Ticket Management

The system functions as a centralized inbox for diverse complaint categories (power outages, billing errors, technical glitches).

- **Workflow Optimization:** I designed the interface to minimize the number of clicks required to view details and change a ticket status.
- **Status Tracking:** Leveraging Vue's reactivity to ensure that when an agent updates a ticket from "Open" to "In Progress" or "Resolved," the change is reflected instantly across the system to prevent duplicate work.

### 2. Stability & Clarity

- **Bootstrap Implementation:** I chose **Bootstrap** for this project to prioritize a standardized, familiar, and responsive grid layout. This ensures that the dashboard remains robust and accessible on various admin devices without the risk of layout breakage during critical operations.
- **Data Visualization:** Presenting complex user data (Location ID, Meter Number, History) in a clean, readable format so agents can make decisions quickly.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue.js:** Used to handle the dynamic state of thousands of tickets without page reloads.
- **Bootstrap:** Selected for rapid development of a consistent, professional, and no-nonsense admin interface.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my experience in building **Enterprise-Grade Internal Tools**. It shows that I understand the specific needs of operational staff—stability, speed, and data clarity—when managing high-pressure customer service workflows.
