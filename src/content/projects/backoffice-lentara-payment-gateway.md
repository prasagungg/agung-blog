## Overview

This project serves as the central command center for the Lentara Payment Gateway. It is a secure Backoffice application used by administrators and finance teams to oversee the flow of money, manage merchant accounts, and monitor the health of transaction channels in real-time.

## Key Focus: Clarity in Financial Data

In Fintech, data density is high. The challenge was to present complex transaction logs in a way that is immediately understandable, allowing admins to spot issues (like high failure rates) instantly.

### 1. Transaction Monitoring & Reconciliation

The core feature of this dashboard is the **Transaction Ledger**.

- **Visual Status Indicators:** I designed a system using Tailwind CSS to clearly distinguish between transaction states (Pending, Success, Failed, Expired) using color-coded badges. This allows operation teams to scan thousands of rows effectively.
- **Granular Filtering:** Implemented advanced search capabilities—filtering by Date Range, Payment Channel (e.g., VA, E-Wallet), and Merchant ID—to help support teams resolve payment disputes quickly.

### 2. Merchant & Settlement Management

Beyond just viewing data, the app manages business logic.

- **Settlement Dashboard:** Built interfaces for calculating and approving payouts to merchants. This required precise data handling on the frontend to ensure the numbers displayed matched the backend calculations exactly.
- **Onboarding Workflow:** A streamlined form wizard for registering new merchants and configuring their active payment channels (MDR settings, active methods, etc.).

## Tech Stack

- **Vue.js:** Chosen for its reactivity, which is crucial when monitoring live transaction feeds that update frequently.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Essential for building complex data tables that are responsive and readable, avoiding the "cluttered" look often found in legacy financial apps.

## Conclusion

This project underscores my capability in the **Fintech Sector**. It demonstrates that I can build high-stakes dashboards where UI clarity translates directly to operational security and financial accuracy.
