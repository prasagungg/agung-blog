## Overview

This website serves as the official digital storefront for the Naraya Serpong housing complex. In the highly competitive real estate market, having a website isn't enough; it must appear on the first page of search results. Therefore, the primary goal of this development was not just aesthetics, but **Search Engine Dominance**.

## Key Focus: Strategic SEO Implementation

The success of this project was defined by its ability to rank organically on Google without relying solely on paid ads.

### 1. Technical SEO Architecture

I structured the website to be perfectly readable by search engine crawlers (Googlebots).

- **Semantic HTML:** ensuring proper use of Heading tags (H1, H2, H3) so engines understand the content hierarchy.
- **Schema Markup:** Implemented structured data to help search engines identify the property type, location, and pricing, enhancing the way results appear in the search listings (Rich Snippets).

### 2. On-Page Optimization

Every element of the page was tuned for specific real estate keywords.

- **Meta & Open Graph:** Crafted compelling Meta Titles and Descriptions to increase Click-Through Rates (CTR) from search results.
- **Image Optimization:** All assets are tagged with descriptive Alt Text, allowing the site to capture traffic from Google Image Search as well.

## Tech Stack

- **WordPress:** Leveraged for its powerful ecosystem of SEO tools
