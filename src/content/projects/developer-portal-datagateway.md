## Overview

The Datagateway Developer Portal is a self-service platform designed to bridge the gap between the backend services and external developers. Its primary function is to facilitate the seamless integration of Datagateway's APIs by providing a streamlined registration process, credential management, and accessible technical documentation.

## Key Focus: Developer Experience (DX)

Building a product for other developers requires a different approach than building for general users. The priority here was **frictionless onboarding** and **clarity**.

### 1. Streamlined Onboarding & Key Management

The goal was to allow developers to start coding as quickly as possible.

- **Self-Service Registry:** I implemented a flow where developers can register, create teams, and generate their own API Keys/Secrets instantly without waiting for manual admin approval.
- **Credential Security:** The UI handles sensitive information (like hiding/showing API secrets) with strict UX patterns to prevent accidental leaks while ensuring ease of copying.

### 2. Interactive API Documentation

Documentation is the most critical part of an API product.

- **Readability First:** Using Tailwind CSS, I designed the documentation layout to be highly readable, with clear separation between endpoint explanations, request parameters, and response examples.
- **Navigation:** Implemented an intuitive sidebar and table of contents logic to help developers jump between different API modules quickly, reducing the time spent searching for technical details.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue.js:** Ideal for creating a fast, single-page application experience where developers can switch between documentation pages without reloading.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used to create a clean, modern, and distraction-free interface that focuses the user's eye on the code and content.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to design for a **Technical Audience**. It highlights my understanding that for an API product to be successful, the "Front Door" (the portal) must be inviting, intuitive, and efficient.
