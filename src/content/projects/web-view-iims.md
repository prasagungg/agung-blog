## Overview

This application was developed specifically for the **Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS)**. It is a lightweight WebView designed to be accessed by event attendees via mobile devices. The core functionality allows users to validate their attendance and claim exclusive digital vouchers instantly while on the event floor.

## The Challenge: The 24-Hour Sprint

The most significant aspect of this project was the timeline. **I was given a strict 24-hour deadline** to take the concept from requirement to a deployable product.

### Delivering Under Pressure

With absolutely no room for delays or major revisions, I had to adopt a hyper-focused development strategy:

1.  **Prioritization:** I stripped the requirements down to the absolute essentials—authentication and the claim logic—to ensure the core flow was unbreakable.
2.  **Speed with Tailwind:** I utilized Tailwind CSS to rapidly style the UI without leaving the HTML structure. This eliminated the time usually spent on writing custom CSS and context switching.
3.  **Simplicity:** Since users would be opening this in a crowded, noisy event environment, the UI had to be intuitive immediately. There was no time for a learning curve; it had to work instantly.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue.js:** Chosen for its ease of setup and development speed.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Critical for styling the interface rapidly within the tight timeframe.

## Conclusion

This project was a test of efficiency and focus. Successfully delivering a bug-free application for a major public event in just one day demonstrated my ability to remain calm under pressure and choose the right tools to get the job done fast.
